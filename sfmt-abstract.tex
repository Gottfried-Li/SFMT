Randomness should be the first requirement to 
pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs),
but the speed is another important factor.
Here we propose a high speed PRNG which fits to recent CPU
architectures with long pipelines and SIMD instructions,
e.g., Intel Pentium 4, AMD64 and PowerPC G5, with 
retaining the good randomness. 

We choose a simplest design,
namely a version of Twisted GFSR, where 
the state space is a simple array. 
This fits to modern CPU architectures
better than Mersenne Twister (MT), Pulmonary MT or WELL 
(where the state space is not a simple array which 
breaks the pipeline.)

Our design generates a 128-bit pseudorandom integer
at one time by SIMD instructions.
The recursion formula is
\[x_{n+1} = Ax_n + Bx_m + Cx_{n-1},\]
where each of $x_i$ is a 128-dimensional vector over the two 
element field ${\mathbb F}_2$ and
$A$, $B$ and $C$ are $128 \times 128$ matrices over
${\mathbb F}_2$.

We separate the generated 128-bit integer 
into two 64-bit integers or four 32-bit integers.
In this case,
there arises some difficulty in using lattice method
to compute the higher dimensional distribution property:
we solve this by 
using a redundant (two or four times larger, respectively) 
state-space representation.

Another speed-up is realized by 
``fill\_array function,'' that fills 
a user-specified length of array with pseudorandom numbers. 
This is much faster than returning one number per one call.
In addition, we use a larger state 
than MT, namely 44497,
which takes full advantage of pipeline
and can be accomodated in modern CPU's cache.

%Lastly, we explicitly use SIMD-instrution generation 
%capability of Intel C++ Compiler and GCC: we expected that 
%C-compiler optimizers would be enough smart
%to generate SIMD instructions for dealing 128-bit 
%integers, but those tested are not. 

As a result, we obtain a 
new PRNG SFMT (Simple and Fast MT), 
roughly 3 times faster than MT, as shown in the next table.
We also show that the quality of randomness of SFMT 
is comparable with MT.
