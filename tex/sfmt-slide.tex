\begin{slide}
  Our Goal is to get the Pseudo-Random Number Generator, which is
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Faster than Mersenne Twister
    \item almost same quality of randomness as Mersenne Twister
  \end{itemize}

  Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item It has tipically 128 bit registers which is divided into 4
    32-bit registers or 8 16-bit registers or 16 8-bit registers.
  \item Pentium IV CPU has SIMD instructions called SSE2.
  \item PowerPC G4, G5 has alti
  \end{itemize}
