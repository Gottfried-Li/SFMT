============================================================================

This software provides a GNU like library package that includes the official
dSMFT-1.1 double precision SIMD oriented Fast Mersenne Twister random number
generator. 

The library can be used only on systems which support IEEE754 floating point
arithmetic.

The generic installation procedure is described in the INSTALL file.
However, to obtain a maximum performance and gain from SSE2 or AltiVec CPU
extensions you should set CFLAGS environment variable to some CPU-specific
optimisation options of your compiler and use `--enable-sse2' or
`--enable-altivec' configure switches. For instance, configuration of the
library for Pentium-M architecture using GCC 4.x.x compiler can be done as
follows:

  % export CFLAGS="-O3 -march=pentium-m -fomit-frame-pointer" 
  % ./configure --enable-sse2

The target generator can be configured to use various periods of the
generated sequence. The period of the sequence is defined as 2^MEXP-1, where
MEXP can be set to: 607, 1279, 2281, 4253, 11213, 19937, 44497, 86243 or
132049. The default setting is 19937.
To change the default period of the generator sequence `--with-mexp=VALUE'
option should be used, e.g.:

 % ./configure --enable-sse2 --with-mexp=607 \
     CFLAGS="-O3 -march=pentium-m -fomit-frame-pointer"
